# Changelog

## Unreleased

## 0.1.2 - 2026-07-10

- Added the **Rbsync Viewer**: a new tab in the Renium sidebar where you drag any `.rbsync` file (or double-click one in the Explorer) to see its full instance tree — class icons, properties, attributes, and script source, with a filter box. Decoding goes through the `renium view` CLI so what you see matches exactly what syncs.
- Added **renium-link**: control one script's source from a single place and mirror it into multiple targets. Sources can be local, git (public/private), or Wally. Targets are read-only mirrors (with an `L` Explorer badge and native read-only editor) until broken. New commands: `Apply Links`, `Add Link`, `Link Status`, `Break Link`, `Reveal Link Source`, plus a `renium-link.json` manifest watcher and `renium.link.*` settings.
- Hardened **Wally** sync: dropped the Rojo dependency (packages are imported directly), added `wally.lock`-aware no-op detection, and added multi-realm import (`shared`/`server`/`dev`) via `renium.wallySync.realms`.
- Added a locked, version-checked release build that regenerates the VSIX and both Studio plugin artifacts with a checksum/provenance manifest.

## 0.1.1

- Added Renium GitHub sync in the main Renium panel with a normal tab layout, src-only default scope, git status/fetch/pull/commit/push flows, and optional Studio re-apply after pull.
- Added explicit `Renium: Export Game File` support for writing the current `src` tree to `.rbxl` / `.rbxlx` place files without changing GitHub sync's src-only default.
- Added git parsing/redaction helpers plus focused tests for GitHub sync parsing and commit-message utilities.
- Reduced Studio live-sync polling pressure by using a 250ms base interval with adaptive idle/error backoff.
- Wait for the Properties webview to signal readiness before sending the first property payload.
- Updated live-sync documentation and setting descriptions to match current two-way sync behavior.

## 0.1.0

- Initial VS Code/Cursor extension scaffold for Renium with native executables.
- Added command palette actions, status bar entry, output logging, live sync process management, and auto-sync-on-save support.
