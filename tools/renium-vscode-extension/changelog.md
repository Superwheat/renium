# Changelog

## Unreleased

## 0.1.3 - 2026-08-13

- Added batched Roblox Open Cloud requests with bound universe and place expansion, escaped path parameters, conditional requests, retry metadata, and Data Store support.
- Added Creator Store and user-inventory search, supported asset insertion, model generation jobs, local image validation, image upload, and official Roblox documentation reads.
- Added script search, saved-source reads, literal grep, exact multi-edit operations, temporary camera capture, and adjustable pathfinding speed to the agent API.
- Added ordered keyboard and mouse sequences sent only to the selected Studio window without moving the system cursor or taking focus.
- Added exact-window Studio and play-client recording as animated WebP clips.
- Reorganized the Rust crate into feature-focused modules and updated release validation for the new layout.
- Removed generated Studio plugin bundles from source control; release and extension builds now create them from the Luau source.

## 0.1.2 - 2026-07-10

- Added experience projects with separate place roots, exact GameId/PlaceId routing, active-place switching, and renameable aliases.
- Bundled the matching Renium CLI and `rbx` launcher with the extension so projects no longer need local executable copies.
- Pinned every multi-channel command to one Studio runtime so two windows on the same place cannot be mixed during chunked or parallel sync.
- Added Studio undo recordings, Explorer selection preservation, CollectionService tag tracking, and first-error batch stopping for filesystem-to-Studio changes.
- Hardened imports and uploads with recoverable stale-file backups, bounded/expiring sessions, explicit cancellation, and fail-closed place-guard reloads.
- Ignored line-ending-only script differences while preserving the filesystem's CRLF/LF convention.
- Made ordinary compile, test, package, and release builds use checked-in generated metadata without launching Studio; API and icon refreshes are now explicit maintenance commands.
- Expanded release verification with Rust formatting/Clippy, Linux/macOS tests, generated plugin parsing, binary round-trip fixtures, and Rojo builds for both plugin formats.

- Added the **Renium Store Viewer**: a new tab in the Renium sidebar where you drag any `.renium` file (or double-click one in the Explorer) to see its full instance tree, class icons, properties, attributes, and script source. Decoding goes through the `renium view` CLI so what you see matches exactly what syncs.
- Added **renium-link**: control one script's source from a single place and mirror it into multiple targets. Sources can be local, git (public/private), or Wally. Targets are read-only mirrors (with an `L` Explorer badge and native read-only editor) until broken. New commands: `Apply Links`, `Add Link`, `Link Status`, `Break Link`, `Reveal Link Source`, plus a `renium-link.json` manifest watcher and `renium.link.*` settings.
- Hardened **Wally** sync: dropped the Rojo dependency (packages are imported directly), added `wally.lock`-aware no-op detection, and added multi-realm import (`shared`/`server`/`dev`) via `renium.wallySync.realms`.
- Added a locked, version-checked release build that regenerates the VSIX and both Studio plugin artifacts with a checksum/provenance manifest.

## 0.1.1

- Added Renium GitHub sync in the main Renium panel with a normal tab layout, src-only default scope, git status/fetch/pull/commit/push flows, and optional Studio re-apply after pull.
- Added explicit `Renium: Export Game File` support for writing the current `src` tree to `.rbxl` / `.rbxlx` place files without changing GitHub sync's src-only default.
- Added git parsing/redaction helpers plus focused tests for GitHub sync parsing and commit-message utilities.
- Reduced Studio live-sync polling pressure by using a 250ms base interval with adaptive idle/error backoff.
- Wait for the Properties webview to signal readiness before sending the first property payload.
- Updated live-sync documentation and setting descriptions to match current two-way sync behavior.

## 0.1.0

- Initial VS Code/Cursor extension scaffold for Renium with native executables.
- Added command palette actions, status bar entry, output logging, live sync process management, and auto-sync-on-save support.
